Ionosonde Project, Job Interview, Programming Exercise

The Sodankyl√§ Meteor Radar measures horizontal winds in the altitude region from about 80 to 100 km.

Task: Read the data file (hw20150120sodankyla.txt) using your favourite programming language, and plot zonal and meridional wind velocity as a function of time and altitude. Send to us the plot (pdf) and the program code and a brief answer to the question "What do you see in the plot?"

Data file description:

The data file contains wind data for 20 January 2015. Each altitude block of data starts with a line indicating altitude, followed by the measurement times centred on the measurement interval. E.g. "1.5" refers to the time interval from 01:00 to 02:00. Times are given in hours.

Next, the zonal wind velocities are given for those times, units are m/s. These are followed by meridional winds, and then by points. Points are the numbers of data points that have been used to generate the corresponding wind velocities.

Hints: (1) Be efficient, there are parts that are easier generated than read. (2) Choose a meaningful colour scheme. (3) Comments are a good idea.
